Paul Getty Museum in Brentwood features Western art from the Middle Ages to the present. The museum complex, designed by Richard Meier is a beautiful architectural marvel made of white Italian travertine marble. Panoramic views of Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Mountains, and the Pacific make the campus and gardens picturesque. The vast collection of Impressionist paintings—including a rare early Edouard Manet pastel, “Portrait of Julien de la Rochenoire,” acquired and exhibited for the first time in June 2014—as well as gilded French furniture, decorative arts and contemporary photography. One of the highlights within the galleries include van Gogh’s Irises, painted in an asylum in the last year of his life.","website":"http://www.getty.edu/visit/index.html","media":{"thumbnail":"/v1455233713/GettyMuseum-thumb_gsxvsc.jpg","widescreen":"/v1455233713/GettyMuseum-16x9_lfxyhx.jpg"},"free_days":null,"address":{"formatted_address":"1200 Getty Center Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90049","street_number":1200,"route":"Getty Center Dr","city":"Los Angeles","state":"California","state_short":"CA","postal_code":90049},"location":{"lat":34.0790007,"lng":-118.4751191},"phone":[{"line":"main","number":3104407300,"number_formatted":"(310)440-7300"}],"hours":{"monday":"Closed","tuesday":"10am - 5:30pm","wednesday":"10am - 5:30pm","thursday":"10am - 5:30pm","friday":"10am - 5:30pm","saturday":"10am - 9pm","sunday":"10am - 5:30pm","closed_on":"Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New Years Day"},"admission":[{"type":"Adult","price":0,"note":0}],"parking":1500,"tags":["Free","Gardens","Art","Architecture","History"]},{"name":"Getty Villa","abbreviation":null,"description":"The Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades is one of two locations of the J.
