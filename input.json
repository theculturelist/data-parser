Begun in the mid-1940s and continuing through the early 1960s, the program was spearheaded by John Entenza, the publisher of “Arts and Architecture” magazine. In a challenge to the architectural community, the magazine announced that it would be the client for a series of homes designed to express man’s life in the modern world. Charles and Ray Eames proposed that the home they designed would be for a married couple working in design and graphic arts, whose children were no longer living at home. The House has now become something of an iconographic structure visited by people from around the world.",

Built between 1919 and 1921, it represents his earliest efforts to develop a regionally appropriate style of architecture for Southern California. Wright himself referred to it as California Romanza, using a musical term meaning “freedom to make one’s own form”. Selecting a thirty-­six acre site known as Olive Hill, Wright and Aline Barnsdall worked together to develop a plan that included a home for Barnsdall and her young daughter, two secondary residences, a theater, a director’s house, a dormitory for actors, studios for artists, shops and a motion picture theater. Today, surrounded by a modern theater and art galleries, Hollyhock House comes closer to realizing its original purpose as the centerpiece of a functioning arts complex.",

For decades, Fire Station 27 served Hollywood, the motion picture studios, the stars who lived in the hills and along Sunset Boulevard, and during major emergencies, the entire city at large. The Northridge earthquake nearly brought an end to the magnificent old building, but it was saved from the wrecking ball and rebuilt. Today, Old Fire Station 27 is a completely restored facility, and represents what the station was like when it was in operation. Three apparatus bays are filled with equipment, some dating back to the early 1900s and not to be found anywhere else. In addition, artifacts and equipment of all types are on display, dating from the 1880s through the present day. There are existing and under-development exhibits upstairs as well.\n\nOld Station 27 also includes a Fire Service Research Library and a learning center where fire and life safety lessons are shared with both children and adults",

Named “El Alisal” (\"Place of the Sycamore Trees\") by Charles Fletcher Lummis, he constructed the entire home with his own hands using stones and granite boulders gathered from the Arroyo, concrete, and wood, as well as, the assistance of a few Native American laborers he had trained in carpentry. The design of the home is influenced by mission architecture and the dwellings of the Pueblo Indians. El Alisal referenced its surroundings and provided sanctuary from the rapid industrialization of Los Angeles.",

This exhibit begins during Reagan's childhood in Dixon, Illinois, and follows his life through his film career and military service, marriage to Nancy Davis Reagan, and political career. A full-scale replica of the Oval Office—a feature of most presidential libraries—is a prominent feature of this museum as well. \n\nThe hilltop grounds provide expansive views of the area, a re-creation of a portion of the White House Lawn, and a piece of the Berlin Wall. An F-14 Tomcat (BuNo 162592) is also located on the grounds.",
